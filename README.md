## 🎯 The Small Clinic Cyber Crisis

### 📊 The Numbers Don't Lie

- **60%** of small clinics hit by cyberattacks close within 6 months
- **$50K+** average cost per incident (downtime + recovery + lost patients)
- **6-18 months** typical insurance claim settlement time
- **$2K-3K/day** typical operating costs for small clinics
- **45-60 days** typical operating cash runway

### 🔥 The Real Problem

**Small clinics are dying waiting for insurance payouts.** Traditional cyber insurance is:

- ❌ **Reactive** (pays after the damage is done)
- ❌ **Slow** (6-18 month claim process)
- ❌ **Incomplete** (covers 60-70% of losses at best)
- ❌ **Expensive** ($3K-5K/year premiums)

**Meanwhile, clinics hemorrhage $2K+ daily with zero revenue during downtime.**
