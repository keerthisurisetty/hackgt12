# üè• Clinic Financial Resilience Platform

**Empowering small clinics with cyber-financial resilience**

A Financial Resilience Web Application tailored for small clinics, helping them understand, recover from, and protect against cyber-related financial loss.

## Problem Statement

Small, private clinics are highly vulnerable to cyberattacks, which can disrupt services, drain finances, and compromise their ability to operate. Unlike larger institutions, these clinics often lack access to financial resilience and recovery planning tools. Insurance can be complex, expensive, and insufficient for their needs.

## Solution

Our platform provides proactive financial resilience tools specifically designed for small clinics (1-2 doctor practices), offering real-time insights and personalized recovery strategies instead of just waiting for insurance reimbursements.

## Key Features

### üìä Before & After Financial View
- **Before Tab**: Shows typical clinic finances in normal operations
- **After Tab**: Displays post-cyberattack financial impact and recovery projections
- Clean tabbed interface matching modern UX standards

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Recovery Assistant
- Interactive chatbot that explains how different factors impact recovery
- Suggests faster recovery strategies (cost-cutting, fund reallocation, risk diversification)
- Provides personalized recommendations based on clinic profile

### üíº Risk Mitigation & Preparedness
- Savings guidance for future incidents  
- Scenario planning: "What happens if this occurs again?"
- Reduces reliance on traditional insurance through direct, data-driven strategies

## Target Market
- Private clinics with 1‚Äì2 doctors
- Clinics without in-house IT or financial recovery tools  
- Cost-conscious providers who need simple, actionable insights

## Differentiator vs Insurance
- **Insurance**: Reactive, delayed/limited payouts after losses
- **Our Platform**: Proactive, real-time insights, personalized strategies, future planning
